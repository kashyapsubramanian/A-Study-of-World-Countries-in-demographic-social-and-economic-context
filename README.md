# A-Study-of-World-Countries-in-demographic-social-and-economic-context

Investigate a Dataset. I have analyzed data from Gapminder World - which has collected data about people in different countries and reported my findings

## Instruction

For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

## Step One - Choose Your Data Set

Gapminder dataset - Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. 

## Step Two - Get Organized

The project folder contains the following files:
- Jupyter notebook used for analysis
- HTML document generated from the notebook
- Dataset files

## Step Three - Analyze Your Data

I have tried to answer the following questions from the dataset.
1. What is global population? How has it been changing?
2. With change in population, how is migration pattern in world countries ?
3. With the change in population, what is the change in birth rate and death rate?
4. With increase in population, how much has the country increased in human development?
5. Is there a relationship between Human Development Index and Income?
6. How are relationships between other variables?

## Step Four - Share Your Findings

The results are shared in HTML format generated using Jupyter notebook.
